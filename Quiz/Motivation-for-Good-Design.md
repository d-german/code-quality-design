# Multiple Choice Questions: Motivation for Good Design

## Question 1
According to the article, software entropy refers to:
- [ ] A measure of how efficiently a program uses memory
- [x] The tendency of software systems to become more disordered over time
- [ ] The speed at which software executes its functions
- [ ] The rate at which new features are added to software

## Question 2
The "Bag of Bricks" analogy is used to illustrate:
- [ ] How to efficiently organize code modules
- [ ] The importance of using design patterns
- [x] Why systems naturally tend toward disorder rather than order
- [ ] The relationship between code size and performance

## Question 3
Which statement best describes the relationship between software modification and entropy?
- [ ] Modifying software always decreases its entropy
- [ ] Software entropy remains constant regardless of modifications
- [ ] Software entropy decreases proportionally to the size of modifications
- [x] When software is modified, its entropy will increase unless actively worked against

## Question 4
According to the article, what is easier to change?
- [x] An ordered system with low entropy
- [ ] A disordered system with high entropy
- [ ] Both are equally easy to change
- [ ] It depends on the programming language used

## Question 5
The Law of Change by Max Kanat-Alexander states that:
- [ ] Software should never change after it is deployed
- [ ] The chance of introducing defects decreases with larger changes
- [x] The longer a program exists, the more probable it is that any piece of it will have to change
- [ ] Changes should be made to software only when absolutely necessary

## Question 6
What is the relationship between the size of changes made to software and the chance of introducing defects?
- [ ] They are inversely proportional
- [x] They are directly proportional
- [ ] There is no relationship between them
- [ ] The relationship depends on the developer's experience

## Question 7
According to the article, what is the best design?
- [ ] The one that requires the least code
- [ ] The one that executes the fastest
- [ ] The one that is the most visually appealing
- [x] The one that allows for the most change in the environment with the least change in the software

## Question 8
What does the second law of thermodynamics imply about software systems?
- [ ] Software systems naturally become more organized over time
- [x] Software systems tend toward disorder unless energy is expended to maintain order
- [ ] Software systems maintain the same level of order throughout their lifetime
- [ ] The organization of software systems is random and unpredictable

## Question 9
When designing a system to be maintainable, we should aim to:
- [ ] Maximize its initial software entropy
- [x] Minimize its initial software entropy
- [ ] Keep software entropy at a moderate level
- [ ] Ignore software entropy entirely

## Question 10
Why is it important to design for evolution in software?
- [ ] To make the software run faster
- [ ] To reduce the initial development time
- [x] To structure the program to evolve through changes in requirements and technology
- [ ] To minimize the need for documentation
