**Generating Questions from file**

Looks like the user wants me to apply the same procedure as before to their new file, "Self-Validating-Value-Objects-in-C.md." I'll need to generate multiple-choice and open-response questions that follow the detailed instructions, like using plausible distractors, randomizing the correct answers, and ensuring that at least one or two questions have combined answers. I’ll also need to make sure the questions are based on this new file content. After inspecting the document, I’ll format everything in markdown and share it.

**Generating Questions From File**

I see that the user wants me to create multiple-choice and open-response questions based on the content from the "Self-Validating Value Objects" file. First, I need to ensure the questions follow all the instructions: diverse distractors, including options like "All of the above" or "None of the above," plus five MCQs that reflect key concepts from the file. I'll also make sure to include concise open-response questions with clear example answers. Afterward, I'll format the output using markdown and make sure the questions are clear and properly structured.

### Multiple Choice Questions

**1. Which characteristic defines a self-validating value object?**

- [ ] It is mutable and defers validation externally.  
- [x] It embeds validation and remains immutable.  
- [ ] It stores object identity rather than value equality.  
- [ ] It requires external validators for each instantiation.  

**2. What drawback does the traditional `SearchService.Search(string)` design exhibit?**

- [x] It duplicates validation logic on every call.  
- [ ] It limits queries to a fixed maximum length.  
- [ ] It relies on untyped string concatenation.  
- [ ] It omits performance optimizations for caching.  

**3. In the `SearchQuery` record, where does validation occur?**

- [ ] In the constructor body.  
- [x] In the `init` accessor of the property.  
- [ ] In a static factory method.  
- [ ] In the `ToString()` override.  

**4. What benefit does the implicit conversion from `string` to `SearchQuery` provide?**

- [x] It allows passing strings directly while enforcing validation.  
- [ ] It bypasses property setters for performance gains.  
- [ ] It enables conversion of null values to empty queries.  
- [ ] It converts queries into uppercase formats automatically.  

**5. Which of the following are advantages of using `SearchQuery` value objects?**

- [ ] Encapsulation of validation logic.  
- [ ] Extension of the type system with domain types.  
- [ ] Reduction of runtime null checks.  
- [x] All of the above.  

**6. What exception is thrown when a `SearchQuery` is initialized with `"su"`?**

- [x] `ArgumentException`  
- [ ] `InvalidOperationException`  
- [ ] `NullReferenceException`  
- [ ] None of the above

### Open Response Questions

**1. Explain why wrapping a primitive type in a self-validating value object can improve code quality.**  
*Example response:* Wrapping a primitive centralizes validation, prevents invalid values from ever being created, and lets the compiler enforce domain rules.

**2. Describe how the `required` keyword in the `SearchQuery` record contributes to object validity.**  
*Example response:* The `required` modifier ensures that the `Query` property must be set during initialization, preventing uninitialized or invalid objects.

**3. Outline potential trade-offs when using implicit conversions in domain value objects.**  
*Example response:* Implicit conversions improve ergonomics by allowing direct string assignment, but they can obscure validation timing and may lead to unexpected exceptions at runtime.
