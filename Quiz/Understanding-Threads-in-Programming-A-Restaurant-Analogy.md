### Open-Response Questions

**Open 1.** Using the restaurant analogy, explain the difference between concurrency and parallelism in programming.

*Example answer:* Concurrency is like a single chef juggling multiple dishes by switching tasks, while parallelism is several chefs cooking different dishes simultaneously.

**Open 2.** Describe a real-world coding scenario where asynchronous operations do not consume additional threads, using the kitchen analogy to illustrate your point.

*Example answer:* Awaiting file I/O is like putting ingredients into a slow cooker and letting it run—while the oven cooks, the chef (thread) can prepare other dishes without occupying another chef.
