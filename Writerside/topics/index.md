# Code Quality and Design

## Introduction

This document is a practical guide to help with software development mentoring and code review. It is a selected
collection of principles, patterns, and examples I have gathered over time. It is not a complete textbook that covers
everything.

This guide focuses on specific topics that I believe are very important for real coding work. Sometimes, these topics
are not focused on in schools or other learning materials.

A key example is the idea of "preferring composition over inheritance." Many developers are taught inheritance
extensively, but understanding when and why to use composition instead is crucial for building flexible and maintainable
software.

Many ideas here come from books and articles I have read (you will see the sources mentioned).
