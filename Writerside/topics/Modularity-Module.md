# Modularity, Module

Software design should be modularized. (Dianxiang Xu 83)

A software module is a container of elements. For example, a method is a container of statements, whereas a class is a
container of instance variables, class variables, constructors, and methods. (Dianxiang Xu 85)

Modularity is the degree to which we separate the components of a system. A modular design divides complex software into
uniquely named modules. These modules can be methods (functions), classes, interfaces, packages, etc.
