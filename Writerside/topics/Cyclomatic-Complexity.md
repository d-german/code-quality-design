# Cyclomatic Complexity

A measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program module. Cyclomatic complexity is a measure for
the complexity of code related to the number of ways there are to traverse a piece of code. This determines the minimum
number of inputs you need to test all ways to execute the program.

Should strive for a value less than 10.
