# Coupling

Coupling is the degree of interdependence between modules or
the strength of the relationship between modules.

“Software modules should aim for loose coupling.”

This is a foundational design principle.

Classes that follow the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
tend to be loosely coupled.
