# ETC Principle

**Easy to Change (ETC) principle**  
Good Design Is Easier to Change Than Bad Design

Much of the **SOLID Design Principles** could be thought of as a special case of ETC.

- **Why is decoupling good?**  
  Because by isolating concerns, we make each concern easier to change.

- **Why is the Single Responsibility Principle useful?**  
  Because a change in requirements is mirrored by a change in just one module.

- **Why is naming important?**  
  Because good names make code easier to read, and you have to read it to change it.
